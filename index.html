<h1>Dyssynchrony</h1>
<p>The synchronicity of cardiac action is important to maintain cardiac
output. Diseased hearts often develop dyssynchrony thus worsening the
already affected ventricle. Current measurements for dyssynchrony based on
Strain and Strain Rate Echocardiography only analyse peak values and tend
to ignore the shape and progession of strain throughout the whole
cycle.</p>
<p>We developed a new measurement of cardiac dyssynchrony based on
inner-vector angles comparing the whole cardiac cycle. Detailed methods and
scientific background can be found in <em>Regional Cardiac Dysfunction and
Dyssynchrony in a Murine Model of Afterload Stress</em> - Michael Bauer,

<p>We decided to release the Software used to calculate the novel
measurement of cardiac dyssynchrony as Free and Open Source Software. It
currently supports data exports from Visualsonic and TomTec strain software
packages.</p>
