<h1>Dyssynchrony</h1>
<p>
The synchronicity of cardiac myocardial function is important for
maintaining cardiac output. Diseased hearts often develop dyssynchrony
that, in turn, worsens the performance of an already impaired ventricle.
Conventional measurements of dyssynchrony are based on the relative timing
of absolute peak values of strain and strain rate, assessed using
echocardiography. These methods do not account for the shape and
progression of strain changes that occur over the course of the cardiac
cycle.
</p>
<p>
We have developed a new measurement of cardiac dyssynchrony based on
inner-vector angles of strain changes occurring over the whole cardiac
cycle. Details regarding the methods and scientific background for this
approach can be found in <em>Regional Cardiac Dysfunction and Dyssynchrony in a
Murine Model of Afterload Stress</em> - Michael Bauer, Susan Cheng, Kazumasa
Unno, Soeun Ngoy, Fen-Chiung Lin, Ronglih Liao [article submitted for
publication].
</p>
<p>
We have released our software based algorithm used to calculate
the novel measurement of cardiac dyssynchrony as Free and Open Source
Software. This software currently supports data exports from Visualsonic
and TomTec strain software packages.
